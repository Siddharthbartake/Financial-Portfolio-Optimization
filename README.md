# Financial-Portfolio-Optimization
This project optimizes a Mean-Variance portfolio using tickers from 2016 to March 2021. Data is cleaned using RStudio, PostgreSQL, and Excel. A custom calendar identifies trading days and holidays. The portfolioâ€™s performance is compared to the SP500TR benchmark, and time-series analysis predicts future values, assessing trends and fluctuations.

* Executive Summary:
This project focuses on optimizing a Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio with twelve unique stock tickers selected by each of the group members using data from 2016 to 2021 (until March 26). The data is collected from sources such as Quandl and Yahoo Finance and is cleaned using ETL processes in RStudio.
The objective of the project is to optimize the portfolio to maximize projected returns while minimizing financial risk. The portfolio is compared to the SP500TR benchmark data to assess its performance.
The project uses technologies and software such as RStudio, R language, PostgreSQL, and Excel. R is a statistical toolkit used to analyze data and produce statistical tools. The stock tickers are selected based on the initials of the group members' last names.
The project uses a custom calendar to extract daily data such as prices and returns from the dataset. The custom calendar is created using Excel to identify trading days and public holidays. The mean-variance portfolio is optimized by grouping the twelve different stock tickers. It uses the mar (minimum acceptable return) to find the optimal solution for the specifications provided in portfolio analytics.
The project concludes by analyzing the portfolio's performance against the benchmark data and predicting future values using time-series analysis. The report provides cumulative and annualized returns for the selected stock tickers, along with general or seasonal trends and any irregular fluctuations.
