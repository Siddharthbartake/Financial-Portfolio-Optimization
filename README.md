# Financial-Portfolio-Optimization
This project optimizes a Mean-Variance portfolio using tickers from 2016 to March 2021. Data is cleaned using RStudio, PostgreSQL, and Excel. A custom calendar identifies trading days and holidays. The portfolioâ€™s performance is compared to the SP500TR benchmark, and time-series analysis predicts future values, assessing trends and fluctuations.
